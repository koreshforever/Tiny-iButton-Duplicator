# Tiny-iButton-Duplicator
A small 1-wire key duplicator on ATtiny13

Pressing the button once changes the cell for reading/writing the key, the number of winks after pressing corresponds to the cell number. Double-pressing the reset button switches between reading and writing mode. A continuously glowing indicator indicates the reading mode, a flickering indicator indicates the recording mode. When the key is successfully recorded, the duplicator blinks three times.

Only DS1990 and RW1990 are suitable for operation.
